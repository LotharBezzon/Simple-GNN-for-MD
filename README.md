# Simple-GNN-for-MD
A GNN for water classical dynamic simulation.
To train the model I simulated liquid water with different initial conditions, number of molecules and temperature (a more detailed description will be added).
The aim is to test the model with a much larger number of molecules than the examples in the training set.
